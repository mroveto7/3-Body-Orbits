# 3-Body-Orbits
Some python code I made a while back to solve a three body problem using fourth-order runge-kutta in order to teach myself some python. Not the prettiest or neatest code, but works pretty well.

There's one code that is fourt-order runge-kutta with fixed time step (standard rk4), and one that implements adaptive time step via a runge-kutta-fehlberg approach to achieve rk4 accuracy embedded in fifth-order rk.

There's a couple of other files that I believe were for data post-processing (or pre-processing, I don't remember it's been awhile). THen I plotted/animated in something else, but that's not worth putting up here. I believe I used Mathematica, which was really slow.

Initial conditiona for some of the stable orbits came from the following site/research http://three-body.ipb.ac.rs/
